<!--Context: list[@continued-from]
Test: assert    preceding::list[(@id = $rid) and @list-type = $type]
Message: List (with the type ) has the continued from attribute which references a list with the id '', but there is no list before it with that id and the same type. Either the continued-from value is incorrect, the types need to be made the same, or the lists need to be moved so that they reference each other correctly. -->
