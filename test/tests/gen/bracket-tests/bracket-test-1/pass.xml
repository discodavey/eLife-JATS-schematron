    <p>It has also been consistently reported that the neuropil is characterized by a much higher number of excitatory contacts compared to inhibitory synapses in different brain regions and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Beaulieu and Colonnier, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Bourne and Harris, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Defelipe, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Domínguez-Álvaro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Megı́as et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Santuy et al., 2018a</xref>). In the present study, the density of inhibitory synapses was particularly low in most CA1 layers (AS:SS ratio in all layers was around 95:5 except for in SLM, where the ratio was close to 90:10). This data is in line with our study using FIB/SEM to analyze the synaptic density in the mouse (where the proportion of synapses that were inhibitory was 8% in the SLM, and approximately 2% in the case of the SR and SO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Santuy et al., 2020</xref>) and in the rat CA1 field (where 4% of the synapses in SR were inhibitory; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Blazquez-Llorca et al., 2020</xref>).</p>
