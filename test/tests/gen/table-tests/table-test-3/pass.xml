Test: report    thead and tbody/tr/th[not(following-sibling::td)] and count(descendant::tr) gt 45
Message:  has a main header (thead), but it also has a header or headers in the body and contains 45 or more rows. The main (first) header will as a result appear at the start of any new pages in the PDF. Is this correct? Or should the main header be moved down into the body (but still captured with <th> instead of <td>) so that this header does not appear on the subsequent pages?
