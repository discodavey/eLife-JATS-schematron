      <title>Test 1</title>
      <p>In this study, we reveal that two variants of COQ-2, derived from alternative splicing of
        mutually exclusive exons, are the key for the choice to synthesize RQ or UQ. We find that
        one of the mutually exclusive exons is only found in the genomes of animals that synthesize
        RQ and that its inclusion remodels the core of the COQ-2 enzyme. We show that the removal
        of this exon abolishes almost all RQ biosynthesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.
        Finally, we find that inclusion of this RQ-specific exon expression is increased in the
        stages of the parasite life cycle where they encounter hypoxic conditions and
        increase RQ production, while the alternative exon is increased in normoxic life stages. We
        thus conclude that alternative splicing of COQ-2 is the key mechanism that causes the switch
        from UQ to RQ synthesis in the parasite life cycle.</p>
